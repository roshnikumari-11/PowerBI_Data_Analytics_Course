# 📊 Power BI Project 1 – Data Science Job Market Dashboard (2024)

This interactive dashboard was created as part of my **Power BI for Data Analytics** course by [Luke Barousse](https://youtu.be/FwjaHCVNBWA?si=48pPmWfopjy2Lqw-) on YouTube.  
It’s the **first complete project** in the course and focuses on solving a real-world problem faced by **job seekers, job switchers, and career explorers in the data field**.

### 🎯 Problem Statement  
Information about the data job market is often **scattered** across different sources and **hard to grasp**.  
This project brings it all together using a **real dataset of 2024 data science job postings**, including job titles, salaries, locations, and more — all within one powerful, easy-to-use interface.
